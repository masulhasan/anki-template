## Instructions

### Installation

#### Direct download (Recommended)

- Click on link in the above table to download the deck with the specific theme.

- Download [`prettify.apkg`](prettify.apkg) to install all the themes in one master deck.

- To download decks for specific note type, choose the note type folder from the `notetypes` directory under the theme directory. (`themes/THEME/notetypes/NOTETYPE`)

> **Note**: Download links to accompanying fonts to themes are provided above. Refer to [Anki Manual - Installing Fonts](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/styling.html#installing-fonts) for instructions.

#### Manual method

Source code (templates and themes) is located in the [`src`](src) directory.

1. Create a new note type (See [Adding a note type](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#adding-a-note-type))
2. Click on `Cards` in browser mode
3. Copy the contents of `NOTETYPE-front.html` and `NOTETYPE-back.html` (from [`templates`](src/templates/default/) directory) into the _Front_ and _Back_ templates of the note type where
4. Copy the content of `THEME.css` (from [`css`](/src/styles/css) directory) into the _Styling_ section where THEME is the name of the theme
5. You can now use the new note type in your collection!

### Usage

1. Download the deck package
2. Open Anki and click on `Import File` (`â‹®` -> `Import` in AnkiDroid)
3. Select the downloaded file
4. The new note type(s), `THEME-NOTETYPE` should be created automatically
5. Use the note type(s) or [clone](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#adding-a-note-type) to adapt to your needs

### Update

To update to the latest version of Prettify (themes/note types), just download the required decks again.

> **Warning**: The already existing templates and styles will be _overwritten_ once you import the deck with updated content. To avoid any loss of edits, it is highly recommended that you use clones of the downloaded note types. (Refer to [Anki manual - Adding a note type](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#adding-a-note-type) for instructions on cloning a note type).
